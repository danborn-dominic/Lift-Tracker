//  Description:
//  This file defines the Mock protocol and the MockActions class, which are essential
//  for unit testing in the Lift-Tracker app. The Mock protocol standardizes the way actions
//  are recorded and verified in mock objects, enabling the simulation of component behavior
//  in a controlled testing environment. MockActions manages the recording and verification
//  of these actions, ensuring the expected behavior of mocks aligns with actual behavior during tests.
//  This file facilitates the creation of robust and reliable unit tests by providing tools to
//  mock and assert interactions within the app's components.

/// `MockActions` is a utility class used in unit testing to manage and verify the actions performed on a mock object.
/// It compares the expected sequence of actions with the actual sequence performed during the test execution.
/// This class is crucial in ensuring that the mock object's interactions align with the expected behavior in the tests.
///
/// - `Action`: A generic type conforming to `Equatable`. Represents the type of actions that can be performed on the mock object.
///
/// The class maintains two arrays:
/// - `expected`: An array of `Action` instances representing the expected sequence of actions in the test.
/// - `factual`: An array that records the actual actions performed on the mock object during the test execution.
///
/// It provides methods to register actual actions and verify them against the expected sequence,
/// thereby ensuring that the mock object's behavior matches the test's specifications.
///
/// Usage:
/// 1. Initialize `MockActions` with a sequence of expected actions.
/// 2. Use `register(_:)` method to record each action performed on the mock.
/// 3. Call `verify(file:line:)` to compare the recorded actions against the expected sequence.
///    If they don't match, the method triggers a test failure with a detailed message.
///
/// - Important:
///   - This class is intended for use in unit testing scenarios and is typically not used in production code.
///   - It assumes that the order and frequency of actions are significant for the test's correctness.
