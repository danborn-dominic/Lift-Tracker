//  MockedPersistentStore.swift
//  UnitTests
//
//  Description:
//  This file contains the MockedPersistentStore class, a crucial component for unit testing in the Lift-Tracker app.
//  The class implements the PersistentStore protocol to provide a mock version of Core Data operations,
//  enabling the testing of database interactions without affecting the actual data.
//  It simulates Core Data functionalities such as fetching, fetching a single object, and updating data,
//  and is designed to work seamlessly with Combine for asynchronous operations.
//  The mock store uses a custom ContextSnapshot structure to track changes in the Core Data context,
//  enabling detailed verification of database operations during tests.
//  Additionally, this class includes utility functions for preloading data into the Core Data context
//  and for cleaning up the mock database, ensuring a consistent state for each test.
//  The implementation leverages Swift's language features, like generics and closures, to provide
//  a flexible and powerful mocking mechanism for database interactions.
