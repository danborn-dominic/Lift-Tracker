//  MockedInteractors.swift
//  UnitTests
//
//  Description:
//  This file provides mock implementations of the RoutineInteractor and ExerciseInteractor protocols used in the Lift-Tracker app.
//  These mocks are utilized for unit testing, allowing for the simulation of routine and exercise interactions without executing actual business logic.
//  Each mocked interactor includes a set of actions that can be expected and verified during tests, ensuring the correctness of the interactor's usage.
//  The file also extends DIContainer.Interactors to include a static method for creating a mocked version of interactors, enhancing the ease of setup for testing.
//  The `verify` function in the extension is crucial for asserting that the expected actions match the actual actions performed during the tests.
//  Overall, these mocks and utilities significantly aid in the unit testing process, providing a controlled environment for testing interactions within the app.
