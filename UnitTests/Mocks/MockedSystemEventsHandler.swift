//  MockedSystemEventsHandler.swift
//  UnitTests
//
//  Description:
//  This file contains the MockedSystemEventsInteractor struct, which provides a mock implementation of the SystemEventsHandler protocol.
//  The mock is used in unit testing to simulate system events such as the app becoming active or resigning active without triggering the actual system events.
//  This allows for controlled testing of the app's response to these system events. The mock tracks interactions through an enumerable 'Action' type,
//  capturing each event for verification in unit tests. This approach ensures that the system event handling within the application behaves as expected
//  under different circumstances, contributing to the robustness of the app.
