//
//  Description:
//  This file defines the AppState structure, which serves as the central point of truth within the Lift-Tracker app.
//  It encompasses all the necessary stateful data to manage the user interface and system behavior. The AppState
//  consists of various nested structures, each dedicated to a specific aspect of the application's state.
//  This includes user data, view routing information, and system-related states. By leveraging the Equatable
//  protocol, AppState supports efficient state comparisons, enabling seamless state management across the app.
