//
//  Description:
//  This file defines the ExerciseInteractor protocol and its implementations: RealExerciseInteractor and StubExerciseInteractor.
//  RealExerciseInteractor handles the business logic related to exercises, including loading, adding, and deleting exercises,
//  and interacting with the ExercisesRepository and AppState. It utilizes Combine for asynchronous operations and state management.
//  StubExerciseInteractor provides a mock implementation for testing and development purposes.
