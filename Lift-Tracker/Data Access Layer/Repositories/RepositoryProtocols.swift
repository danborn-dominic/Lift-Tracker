//
// Description:
//  This file consolidates protocols defining the repository layer for the Lift-Tracker app.
//  It includes RoutinesRepository and ExerciseLibraryRepository, each following CRUD principles
//  for managing routines and exercises respectively. These protocols abstract the data layer's
//  operations, ensuring a decoupled and scalable app architecture. They leverage Combine for
//  reactive and asynchronous data handling.
