//
//  Description:
//  This file defines the `ExerciseLibraryRepository` protocol and its concrete implementation `RealExerciseLibraryRepository`.
//  The repository acts as an intermediary between the persistence layer (Core Data) and the application logic,
//  facilitating CRUD operations for exercises in the exerciseLibrary. It abstracts the underlying data fetching and manipulation
//  mechanisms, providing a clean interface for interacting with exercise data.
//  This includes creating, reading, updating, and deleting exercises, using Core Data and Combine for asynchronous operations.
