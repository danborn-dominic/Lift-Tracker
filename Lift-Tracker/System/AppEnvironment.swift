//  Description:
//  This file defines the AppEnvironment structure, which is responsible for initializing and
//  providing access to the core components of the application such as the dependency injection container
//  and the system events handler. It sets up the application state, repositories, interactors, and other
//  necessary services for the application to function properly.
