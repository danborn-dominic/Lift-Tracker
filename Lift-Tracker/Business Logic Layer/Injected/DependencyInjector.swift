//  Created by Dominic Danborn on 5/12/23.
//
//  Description:
//  This file defines the Dependency Injection (DI) Container for the Lift-Tracker app. The DIContainer
//  struct serves as a central point for managing dependencies throughout the app. It includes
//  AppState for maintaining application state and Interactors for handling business logic.
//  This container is injected into the SwiftUI environment, allowing views to access the app state
//  and interactors as needed. The file also includes extensions for easily injecting the container
//  into views and provides a mechanism for creating a preview environment for development and testing.
