//  Description:
//  This file contains a collection of utility extensions and helper functions designed to
//  enhance the functionality of Combine and SwiftUI. These extensions provide streamlined
//  ways to transform, handle, and manage publishers and subscriptions within the app. Key
//  features include error handling, publisher transformations, and convenience methods for
//  dealing with common asynchronous patterns. These helpers are designed to simplify and
//  reduce boilerplate code in Combine-based asynchronous operations.
