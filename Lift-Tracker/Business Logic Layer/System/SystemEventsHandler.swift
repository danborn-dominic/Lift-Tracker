//  Description:
//  Defines the SystemEventsHandler protocol and its concrete implementation. This protocol is responsible
//  for handling system-level events such as the application becoming active or resigning active. The RealSystemEventsHandler
//  class uses the DIContainer to manage the state of the application in response to these system events.
